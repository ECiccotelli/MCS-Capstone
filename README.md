[Application Link](http://mc-schedulemaker.uc.r.appspot.com/)
A schedule maker for students at Manhattan College. Easily make your schedule, autofill your registration form, and send to your advisor in a few seconds using the MCS. 

# How does the application work?
Our application first takes the most up to date information about courses at Manhattan College and stores this information. Out backend is constantly checking for new updates or changes to courses at Manhattan College. 

You are then able to add any classes to your calendar. If you add two classes at conflicting days and times, our calendar will notify you of the conflict. Additionally, our calendar will notify you if you try to signup for multiple sections of the same course. 

Once your calendar is made, you can use the autofill registration form to autofill your information into the registration PDF. You are then able to save to your email drafts or automatically send the email to your advisor, or anyone else who needs it. Note that the email feature requires you to be logged into your Manhattan College Google Account.
